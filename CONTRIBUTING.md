## 🧱 Code Guidelines
- Keep code **clean**, **well-commented**, and **readable**.
- Follow **PEP8** (Python style guide).
- Use **meaningful variable names**.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies — keep it lightweight.
- Add a short docstring (`"""description"""`) for new functions.

Example:
```python
def get_features(password):
    """Extract features from the given password string."""
    return list(password)
